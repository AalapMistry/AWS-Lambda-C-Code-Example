# ASP.NET MVC CRUD Operations on AWS Lambda

This project demonstrates how to create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using ASP.NET MVC on AWS Lambda.

## Overview

The project uses ASP.NET MVC to create a basic CRUD application for managing items. Each item has an id, name, and description.

## Functionality

- `Index`: Displays a list of all items.
- `Create`: Allows you to create a new item.
- `Edit`: Allows you to edit an existing item.
- `Delete`: Allows you to delete an existing item.

## Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Visual Studio with ASP.NET MVC support.
   - AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio.
   - AWS Lambda and API Gateway configured.

2. **Build and Run Locally**:
   - Open the solution in Visual Studio.
   - Build and run the application locally to test the CRUD operations.

3. **Deploy to AWS Lambda**:
   - Use the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio to deploy the application to AWS Lambda.
   - Configure the API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function.

4. **Testing**:
   - Use the API Gateway URL to access the application and test the CRUD operations.

## Notes

- This project demonstrates a basic CRUD application using ASP.NET MVC on AWS Lambda. For more complex applications, consider using other AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk or Fargate.
